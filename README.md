# MPC5XXX-ledblink
#NXP/Freescale MPC5XXX, STM SPC5 Led blinking code (MPC5634M)

## MPC5XXX family of processors are 32bit PowerPC embedded microprocessor powered by e200 core. (joint developed by Freescale and STMicro) [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPC5xx)

###Unfortunately Freescale seems to have **lost** many of code examples after the NXP acquisition, this example wants to bring some code examples to help those who start with this product.
###The MPC5XXX is particularly interesting in automotive application thanks to its powerful eTPU engine.
